<p>This project building is on “Note Taking Website App Using Pure JavaScript.”</p>
<p>We all have a notes app on our mobiles or laptop.
Note-taking websites are the online equivalent of notebooks, and because they are digital, they can do more for you than paper ever could.</p>
<p>Speech to Text option.</p>
<p>Can edit and save the existing notes.</p>
